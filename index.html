            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>I graduated in 2014 from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After I earned my degree, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career back home in Seattle. I worked in the automotive manufacturing industry for 4.5 years, designing high-tech cameras, lights, and reflectors all over cars and trucks. Part of my time at the company included a year in China at a factory there, gaining hands-on experience with everything from injection molding machines to circuit boards. Seattle is where I grew up, but my China trip was an amazing experience and I hope to return some time this year to see friends and enjoy the food.<br><br>I enjoy engineering, whether its mechanical or software. Even in mechanical engineering, coding skills are becoming more and more valuable. I want to use my Code Fellows education to further my career in tech. I hope to graduate Code Fellows with flying colors and start working for Microsoft, Zillow, Oculus, or Wizards of the Coast!</p>
