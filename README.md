# README.md for About Me

Welcome to my About Me site. This site has details about me, Andrew Casper, and demonstrates my increasing proficiency with html, ccs, and javascipt during my time at Code Fellows. Specifically, I am taking Code Fellows class #201.

This project contains seven questions about me, handled by the javascipt code in the app.js file. The first five questions are yes or no, and let any visitor guess details about me and my life via user prompts and alerts.

The next two questions are more involved, both for the user and from a coding perspective. The first of the two has the user guess the number of siblings I have, giving only four guesses. The second asks the user to name a city in which I have lived besides Seattle, with six guesses to do so.

The site also requests a username and reports to users their final score once they have answered all seven questions. For each question, the code strives to predict any errors in the user input and allow a user to try again should they fail.

Further work on this project will modify the files in this same repo.
